# Testing

## From "Done when" to tests

An issue's "Done when" is the list of tests to write: one case, one test, named
after the case, so a reader can tick the issue off against the test names.

| The issue says | Write | Where |
|---|---|---|
| A table row (`Given` → `Expect`) about a rule, a route or a function | a unit or API test per row | next to the module it tests |
| A table row about what a component shows | a component test per row | next to the component |
| A scenario (`Given / When / Then`) | a browser test per scenario, named after its first line | the web app's `e2e/<feature>` |
| A row or scenario of a `Component` issue (a shared component) | a story per case, named after it, whose `play` function checks it; the story is the test | next to the component |

## How tests are written

- **Test through the interface**: call the module, the route or the screen the
  way its user would. Component tests find controls by role and name, as a
  person does. A test that has to reach past the interface means the module has
  the wrong shape.
- **Each test starts from nothing**: a fresh database, no data or order shared
  with another test.
- **No network in unit and component tests**: replace the API client at its
  seam instead of mocking the network everywhere.
- **Time is given, not read**: code that needs "now" takes it as a parameter or
  from one clock module, so tests set it. Date logic is tested at fixed times,
  including just before and after midnight.
- **Never weaken or delete a test to make a check pass.** If a test is wrong, say
  why in the pull request.
