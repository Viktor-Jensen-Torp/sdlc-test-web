# How conventions work

- **Start at the maps.** Each folder under `.github/aw/conventions/` has a short
  `index.md` saying which documents to read for the paths you will touch. Read
  those, not all of them.
- **The checks decide.** Each file in `.github/aw/checks/` names a command CI
  runs on every pull request. Run them before you finish, and fix everything
  they name. Green there is green in CI.
- **A rule is real when something fails.** Every rule names what checks it: a
  lint rule, the type checker, a test, the `conventions` check, or the reviewer.
  Lint messages say how to fix; follow them.
- **Documents over existing patterns.** Copy the code you find only where it
  matches these documents. Where they disagree, the document wins; note the
  difference in one line of your pull request description.
- **These documents hold what the code cannot show.** When a reviewer flags the
  same thing twice, it becomes a rule, with a check, in the layer it belongs to:
  `chain/` when it holds for any project, the project's own conventions otherwise.
